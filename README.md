# to-do
A cool to-do web app made using NodeJS, ExpressJS, Pug, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The project is hosted at: http://grktodo.herokuapp.com

This hobby project was taken to dig deeper on the full stack web development. The main focus was on a clean UI and cool UX, which is also responsive. The project helped me know about database connectivity, user session management, user privacy, awesome UX design and much more. I got to know about various attacks possible such as SQL Injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS) etc. and how to prevent them. This was a very wholesome project that covered most core aspects of web development.
